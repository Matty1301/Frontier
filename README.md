Frontier is the most recent game I have developed and showcases some of my best work.

This includes many intermediate and advanced level programming techniques such as:  
Coroutines (PlayerController.cs)  
Inheritance   
Events  (SoundManager.cs)   
Callback functions  (PlayerController.cs, PlayGamesPlatformManager.cs)    
Interfaces  (AsteroidController.cs)   
Object pooling  (ObjectPooler.cs)   
Preprocessor directives (PlayerController.cs)
